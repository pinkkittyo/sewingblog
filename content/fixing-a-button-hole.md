First of all let me say a big hello and welcome to my post. I am Rachel, a 41 year old mother of two small children, three cats and I love sewing. I find it to be an enjoyable creative outlet which helps me push aside the day to day stresses of parenting and running around after the man child.

For as long as I can remember, I have always preferred clothing which exudes individuality but have often struggled to find the perfect outfit in the high street. Many a time I have spied the perfectly flared jeans, yet the fit was completely wrong (gaping at the back)! When I discovered a beautiful Boho top, I found the particular fabric pattern just did not call out to me. So what better way to solve this dilemma than to sew my own? I’d have full control over the fit, the material and any embellishments to add that element of personality.

Now, whilst I aspire to have my wardrobe filled with fabulous home sewn creations, I often consider myself as a beginner as there are always new techniques and fabrics to work with. So far, I have made bags, children’s clothes and with the help from my sewing teacher I made a long dress using a gorgeous heavy-weight jersey fabric.

Anyone who sews will have an understanding that no matter how careful you are, mistakes can happen. This of course is the reason behind the handy, well-used invention called the unpicker. I have yet to complete a project without rummaging through my drawer for this nifty gadget. However, some of my mistakes have extended further than undoing a few stitches and whilst at the time I wanted to scream and throw myself face down on the floor (something to my dismay, my baby boy has recently discovered!), I can attest that even big mistakes can be rectified!

During lockdown, I was unable to attend my sewing class, so to test my home ability I attempted the children’s Freddie Dungarees dress by Two Stitches. I had purchased some lovely Cerise Pink Stars 100% cotton needlecord and cotton poplin for lining. After a frantic twenty minutes trying to convince my toddler to become a statue in order to ascertain her measurements, I traced the pattern size and was ready to go. I remembered the wise words of my sewing teacher regarding nap (raised fuzzy surface on some fabrics), so being mindful of the fabric direction, I cut my pattern pieces ready to sew.

Everything began smoothly - I managed to thread the overlocker (definitely a win for me!), the instructions were simple and my dress was taking shape. That was until the buttonholes! After a successful practice attempt using my 3 step buttonhole programme, I started on the real thing. To my dismay, not only did my machine jam, but my much-loved unpicker became a liability! I had slipped and ripped my beautiful dress.

After a coffee and a few choice words, I had managed to calm down and I fished the dress out of the bin determined to not let it beat me. Thankfully the hole was near the pocket so I carefully measured and removed the affected fabric. I then cut and attached a new piece so the seams were hidden inside the pocket. This time, I used the buttonhole stabiliser attachment to prevent the fabric drag caused by the soft velvety feel of the needlecord and I was able to complete my buttonholes.

In my previous excitement of things going well, I had mistakenly used one of the pattern pieces as a test swatch for my practice buttonholes! Luckily I had enough fabric left over and I was able to finish the dress.

Despite my frustration, making these mistakes was a positive. I now have a better idea of how repairs can be made and my toddler is none the wiser- she is just happy with pockets.

  
Oh, remember how I mentioned above about nap and fabric direction? I had forgotten to pay attention when cutting my replacement piece so if you look very carefully you can see a subtle shade difference on the front bib where the fabric brushes the wrong way....still, for my first lockdown project I was pretty impressed with myself!

## Rachels Tips:

* Always practice button holes on fabric scraps- not your pattern pieces! Labelling pieces may help.
* If something. goes wrong - take a break and come back to it, most things are salvageable.
* Double check the nap and cut all pieces out so the pile brushes in the same direction to prevent subtle differences in shade.
